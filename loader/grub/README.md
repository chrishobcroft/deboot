# GRUB

## Using `grub2-mkconfig`

The `grub2-mkconfig` that ships with your distro tries to read a load of system information from your host system. It tends to find that difficult from inside a container, making it difficult to set up a virtual build environment. (Really what you need is a VM).

For ease of testing, the DeBoot project also ships its own very simple version of that script `grub-mkconfig` that consumes menu entries from a `HASHDIR`. 

## BootloaderSpec

Text configuration files stored in /boot/loader/entries and consumed by (the grub script fragment generated by) `/etc/grub.d/10_linux`, consumed by `grub2-mkconfig`.
