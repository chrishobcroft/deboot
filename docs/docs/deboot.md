# How DeBoot works

The main GitHub repo hosted at https://github.com/debootdevs/deboot is a proof of concept build for a boot sequence that loads a Linux userspace (i.e. root filesystem) from a squashfs hosted on Swarm. The fetcher is an ultralight Bee node (the reference implementation of a Swarm node) inserted into a custom initramfs generated by a fork of the [dracut project](https://github.com/dracutdevs/dracut).

We chose to put a Bee node in the initramfs, as opposed to some earlier stage such as GRUB, as an expedient: since bee is already designed to run on Linux, the software can run at the initramfs stage without any modification. Conversely, getting the bee into GRUB, for example, would require porting it to use GRUB syscalls instead of Linux one; potentially a substantial task. Putting exotic fetchers in the initramfs is a simple and flexible solution that allows for rapid iteration.
